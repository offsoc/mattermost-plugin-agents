# Mock Data Directory

This directory is for optional mock files used when testing PM/Dev tools without real internal search data.

## Usage

When mock mode is enabled in configuration, the MockLoader will look for files in this directory:

- **Exact match**: `{key}.txt` (e.g., `competitor_mentions.txt`)
- **Pattern match**: `{key}_*.txt` (e.g., `competitor_mentions_slack.txt`)

## Examples

For PM tools internal search mocking:
- `competitor_mentions.txt` - Mock data for competitor analysis
- `market_trends.txt` - Mock data for market trends
- `customer_requests.txt` - Mock data for customer feedback

For Dev tools internal search mocking:
- `code_discussions.txt` - Mock internal code discussions
- `error_discussions.txt` - Mock error/debugging conversations
- `architecture_discussions.txt` - Mock architecture discussions

These files are optional - if not present, internal search will simply return no results when real data is unavailable.
